<!-- Q1 What is Redux -->
<!-- A1  It's a state management tool that helps manage the application's state in a predictable way,
     making it easier to develop and maintain complex applications. -->

<!-- Q2 What is Redux Thunk used for?-->
<!-- A2 Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that enables handling asynchronous logic within 
    Redux actions.  -->

<!-- Q3 What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?  -->
<!-- A4  It performs a shallow comparison of the current props and state with the next props and state.
     If there are no differences, the component will not re-render. React.memo for functional components 
     offers similar optimization by memoizing the component based on its props.
    
    When to use:-
    Performance Optimization: Use Pure Components when you need to optimize performance by preventing 
    unnecessary renders.
    Avoiding Unnecessary Updates: In scenarios where you know that the component doesnâ€™t need to update 
    on every parent render, Pure Components can be a good choice to prevent unnecessary updates and optimize rendering.
    Simple State and Props: If a component's props and state are simple and can be shallowly compared for changes, using a
    Pure Component can be beneficial. However, if the props or state are complex objects or arrays, shallow comparison might not be sufficient.

<!-- Q4 What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is its purpose?  -->
<!-- A4 In React, the setState function can take a second argument, which is an optional callback function. This callback is executed after the 
    setState has been completed and the component has been re-rendered.
    
    The purpose of this callback is to perform actions that rely on the updated state or need to be executed after the state has been updated 
    and the component has re-rendered. It's commonly used to handle logic that should occur after the state update is complete. -->
